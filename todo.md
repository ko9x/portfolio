# Notes to add

# Current Focus
* Decide which image to use for MyNotes
    * Can we make it less blurry somehow?
* Get the image and description divs to look good at any screen size
    * Add and remove padding to make the description always the same height as the image?
* Set a breakpoint at around 940px
    * At that point put the project description under the image

# What to do next
* Continue building out the structure of the project
* Make a light mode and a dark mode early on so we don't have to do a bunch of back-tracking later
* Sketch out and incorporate the mobile version early on so we don't have to do a buch of back-tracking later
